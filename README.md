# Poem o' Star Wars

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

**Poem o' Star Wars** makes your credit screens styled like the **Star Wars** series' movie openings!

This means, you will see the texts in end poem and acknowledgements projected in a trapezoid perspective:

May the force be with you!
